# SD-OCT-Points-Based

## Aim 
Spectral Domain-Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) has become an
essential tool to assess the health of ocular tissues in live subjects. The processing
of SD-OCT images, in particular from non-mammalian species, is a labor-intensive
manual process due to the lack of access to analytical programs. The work presented
herein describes the development and implementation of novel computer algorithms
for quantitative analysis of SD-OCT images of live teleost eyes. We hypothesized
that these algorithms, in comparison to manual segmentation of SD-OCT images,
will allow more precise measurement, with significantly higher throughput capacity,
of retinal architecture in live teleost ocular tissue.
Methods Automated segmentation processing of SD-OCT images of the retinal
layers was developed using a novel algorithm based on thresholding, which operates
on the RGB pixel values contained in an image. The algorithm measured the thickness
characteristic of the retina present in the input dataset to provide increased accuracy
and repeatability of SD-OCT analysis over manual measurements. The program was
also designed to allow adjustments of the thresholding variables to suit any specific
image set. A heat map software was created alongside the algorithm to plot the
SD-OCT image measurements as a colour gradient.
